          One of the finest ways to discover 'The White City' is to do so the
          old-fashioned way: on foot, on a free walking tour!The Arequipa
          Walking Tours are led by qualified and licensed tour guides who are
          fluent in both Spanish and English. During the trip, you will see some
          of the city’s most architecturally significant and significant
          buildings.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Arequipa Walking Tour takes you to a variety of important
          historical sites in the city, as well as markets and stores that are
          distinctive to Arequipa. You will see the first hotel and jail in
          Arequipa, the alpaca zoo – where you can pet, feed, and observe how
          alpaca fur is transformed into a variety of apparel – and the San
          Camilo Market. Here you can find subterranean food courts, butchers,
          native spices, fruit booths, and fresh fish! Throughout the day, this
          walking tour is offered twice. The first is at 10:00 a.m., while the
          second is at 15:00 p.m. Depending on the time you choose, the tour’s
          path differs slightly.
